This is an app to determine how far you should jog. For example you had burgers, fries and a soda for lunch. In your evening jog you want to make sure that youâ€™re burning calories. You insert the number of calories that you consumed and the RoadRunner app will give you a distance. You then can use maps to plan your end location. Take a victory selfie after you finish your run.
